* Introduction: CLIs and REPLs

Many programs expose a CLI as their main mode of interaction. It's portable,
predictable, and usable by other programs. Indeed, for one-line commands it's hard to
beat.

But the second you want to do multiple commands the limitations start to show:
- Long command prefixes remain the same between invocations.
- Ephemeral state can't really persist unless it's written to disk.
- The program is starting up from scratch each time.

The classic solution to this is of course a REPL. Indeed we often work with shells
inside their REPL.

tli42 is a tool to help users create REPLs as easily as they might create a CLI.
