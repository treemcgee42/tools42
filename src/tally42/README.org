* Introduction

`tally42` helps introspect personal financial statements.

It ingests `<statement>.toml` files to get the information. It does not currently
persist the data elsewhere. The reasoning behind this is that statements come in a
variety of formats and manual inspection is usually advisable anyways. Transactions
can be written by hand during this process and are also rarely updated. The idea is
that if you download a `statement.pdf` file from your bank you will write a companion
`statement.toml` file. This tool can help you gain insights on all such files at
once.

* Statement toml

Example:

#+begin_src toml
  account = "amex-gold"
  statement-file = "2026-01-19.pdf"
  closing-date = 2026-01-16

  [[transaction]]
  description = "So Gong Dong"
  date = "2025-12-19"
  amount = 41.64
  category = "eating-out"
#+end_src
